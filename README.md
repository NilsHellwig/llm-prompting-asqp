## üìÑ Paper Abstract

Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) enables a detailed understanding of opinions expressed in a text by extracting four elements: the opinion term, aspect term, aspect category, and sentiment polarity for each opinion. However, creating annotated datasets to fine-tune ASQP models is resource-intensive.

In this study, we explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for zero- and few-shot learning on the ASQP task across five diverse datasets. We report F1 scores nearly matching those of state-of-the-art fine-tuned models, and exceeding previously reported zero- and few-shot results. For example, in the 20-shot setting on the Rest16 restaurant domain dataset, LLMs achieved an F1 of **51.54**, compared to **60.39** by the fine-tuned MVP method. On the target aspect sentiment detection (TASD) task, LLMs achieved **68.93** on Rest16 in the 30-shot setting, compared to **72.76** with MVP.

Our findings suggest that while human annotators remain essential for top-tier performance, LLMs can meaningfully reduce the need for extensive manual annotation in ASQP tasks.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- Evaluated LLMs on ASQP and TASD across **five datasets**.
- Tested **0 to 50-shot** settings.
- Introduced a **new airline review ASQP dataset**.
- Compared zero-/few-shot LLMs against fine-tuned small language models (SLMs).
- Investigated **self-consistency prompting**.

## üìä Research Questions

- **RQ1:** How does varying the number of few-shot examples (0‚Äì50) impact ASQP performance?
- **RQ2:** How do LLMs compare to fine-tuned SLMs on ASQP?
- **RQ3:** Does self-consistency prompting improve LLM performance on ASQP?

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # install packages
python study/01_zeroshot.py # run all prompting conditions
